## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with around a year of production experience at New Relic. I had a great internship experience on the Software Architecture team. Eventually I moved full time to the Engineering Operations team where I contributed to maintaining a cluster of microservice applications using Node.js and Ruby on Rails. Engineering Operations built tools for internal incident management, an application for managing engineering team project ownership and monitoring internal service health. During my time, I contributed to new features on our internal incident management Slackbot.

Early in my career, I am an advocate for building better documentation. Over a several month period, I was able to revamp our existing documentation and create Mermaid.js diagrams for each of our microservices. This was immensely helpful when onboarding new engineers and showing leadership our software architecture and possible bottlenecks. 

Some of my other hobbies include building a Home Assistant smart home that integrates and automates every part of my digital life and home. 

I am also greatly interested in music production and synthesizers, with desires to continue work on music plugins and custom vsts for experimental sound design.
